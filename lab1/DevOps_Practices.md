## DevOps Practices
- `Continuous integration`: When the new version of application releases, CI automatically checks if it builds without errors and passes all tests.
- `Continuous deployment`: When the new version passes CI stage, all its changes are automatically released into production environment.
- `Continuous testing`: The process of exeuting automated test during CI/CD pipeline in order to get immediate feeadback on the reliability of new version.
- `Automated code review`: Checking whether the source code complies with the set of practices and doesn't contains any errors or security issues.
- `Cross-functional teams`: When the team contains members from various fields. For example: DevOps, AI, DS etc.

## Scenario
This semester we have a course which is called "Capstone project", where our goal is to create a project and develop it. Our project is an application with an AI model which generates a cocktail by customer's preferences. Right now in our plan there are two features: generate a cocktail by customer's preference (flavor, alcohol strength, alcohol type etc.) and give an existing cocktail by customer's preference. 
- Since our project has both AI model and web application, we gathered a `cross-functional team` with people from **AI**, **DS** and **Software Development**.
- In our plans we have some other features to be implemented, and during development we will improve our existing features. Thus `CI/CD` with `Continuous testing` will be very important for our project in order to check, whether these improvements and additions do not have any bugs and do they work fine together with existing features.
